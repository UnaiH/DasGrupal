Checkers:
Checkers consists of only one type of piece, a checker. At the beginning, you can only move one checker one diagonal
space forward during a regular turn. If your checker is in the diagonal space nearest to one of your opponent's checkers,
then you can jump and capture that checker. To capture a checker, move two diagonal spaces in the direction of the checker
you’re attacking, like you are hopping over your opponent's piece. The space on the other side of your opponent’s checker
has to be empty so that you can move into it. To crown a checker and make it a king checker, simply place one of your
own captured pieces on top of it. The king can move forward and backward diagonally on the dark squares, so it's easier for
king checkers to capture your opponent's checkers
