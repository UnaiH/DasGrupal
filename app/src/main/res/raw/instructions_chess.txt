Chess consists of six types of different pieces. Pawns can only move one square forward (two squares
forward if it's the first time it moves) and once it arrives to the other side of the board it will
be crowned as a Queen. To capture a pawn it has to be taken diagonally.
Rooks (or castles) will be able to move vertically and horizontally across as many squares as they
want, as long as there are no enemy pieces on the way.
Knights will be able to move in 'L' (2 horizontal and 1 vertical moves or vice versa, it doesnt's
matter whether there're enemy or ally pieces on the way). The knight'll capture a piece if in the
end of the movement there's an enemy piece.
Bishops will be able to move diagonally across as many squares as they want, as long as there are no
enemy pieces on the way. Bishops'll take any enemy piece that is on the road.
The Queen will be able to move in any direction she wants without being able of jumping over an
enemy piece.
The King will be able to move like the queen but only one square at a time. If the opponent takes
your king you'll loose the game, otherwise you eats the rival's king you will win the game.
Castling is a special move to protect your king and activate your rook. It's the only time in chess
you can move two pieces in one move. The king moves two squares to the right or left and the rook
moves directly to the other side of the king. You can only castle if neither the rook or king have
moved and there are no pieces in the way. You can also not castle when in check, into check or
through check.
